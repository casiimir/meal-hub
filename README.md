<h1>Yummy - Your Ultimate Recipe App</h1>

<p>Welcome to Yummy, the ultimate recipe app that brings you a vast collection of recipes from different categories and nationalities. We are excited to introduce some new features that will enhance your cooking experience!</p>

<h1>Features:</h1>
<p>

<h2>User Authentication and Login:</h2> With our new login feature, you can create a personalized account and save your favorite recipes for easy access. Your account will also allow you to sync your data across devices, so you never lose your recipe collection.

<h2>Save and Access Recipes:</h2> Once logged in, you can now save recipes to your profile. This way, you can quickly access your favorite recipes whenever you want. Say goodbye to endless searching; your favorite recipes are just a click away!

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions:</h2> We have added detailed step-by-step instructions for each recipe, making it easier for both seasoned chefs and beginners to follow along and create delicious dishes.

<h2>Category Filters:</h2> We understand that sometimes you have a specific craving or dietary preference. Now, you can easily filter recipes based on categories like vegan, gluten-free, comfort food, and more. Finding the perfect recipe has never been simpler.

<h2>Enhanced Fridge Feature:</h2> Our unique ingredient-based search has been taken to the next level. Powered by API calls and Firebase integration, you can now receive even more personalized recipe suggestions based on the ingredients you have in your fridge. Let Yummy inspire your culinary creativity!

<h2>Minimalistic Design:</h2>Enjoy a clean and user-friendly design that simplifies your recipe exploration experience. </p>

<h1>Behind the Scenes:</h1>
<p>
Our app continues to be built on Next.js, taking advantage of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for efficient page rendering and improved SEO performance. To enhance the visual appeal and consistency, we used the React Icon Library for icons and incorporate the Swiper library for smooth and engaging animated sliders.

We have expanded our use of React Hooks, including useState, useEffect, useRouter, and now, to manage state and side-effects more efficiently. The global data management is handled by the UseContext API, ensuring a seamless experience across the app.

In addition to the existing technologies, we have integrated Firebase for user authentication, data storage, and synchronization across devices. Utilizing Firebase's Firestore, we store your saved recipes securely and reliably.</p>
